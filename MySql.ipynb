    "A1. Database:\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored for efficient retrieval, manipulation, and management. It serves as a repository for various types of data, ranging from text and numbers to images and multimedia. Databases are commonly used in applications to store and retrieve information in a structured manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases:\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that use structured query language (SQL) for defining, manipulating, and querying data. They organize data into tables with predefined schemas, where each table represents a specific entity or relationship. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, and Microsoft SQL Server. Key characteristics of SQL databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured Data: Data is stored in well-defined tables with fixed schemas, enforcing data integrity.\n",
    "ACID Transactions: SQL databases ensure data consistency and reliability through the implementation of ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions.\n",
    "Schema Flexibility: While schemas are fixed, they can be altered using predefined migration methods, allowing for changes over time.\n",
    "Relational Model: Data relationships are established using foreign keys, enabling efficient querying and maintaining data integrity.\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Databases:\n",
    "NoSQL databases are a diverse group of database management systems that provide flexible data models and different mechanisms for storing and retrieving data compared to traditional SQL databases. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Neo4j. Key characteristics of NoSQL databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema Flexibility: NoSQL databases allow for dynamic and evolving data structures, making them suitable for scenarios with varying data formats.\n",
    "Scalability: Many NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, making them well-suited for distributed and high-traffic applications.\n",
    "No Fixed Schema: NoSQL databases do not enforce a rigid schema, enabling storage of diverse data types without predefined structures.\n",
    "Eventual Consistency: Some NoSQL databases prioritize availability and partition tolerance over strict consistency, leading to eventual consistency models.\n",
    "Variety of Data Models: NoSQL databases support different data models, such as document, key-value, column-family, and graph, catering to various use cases."

    "Primary Key:\n",
    "A primary key is a special field or combination of fields within a database table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. It serves as a means of ensuring data integrity and providing a way to uniquely reference individual records. In other words, the primary key ensures that there are no duplicate records in the table and allows for efficient indexing and searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of a primary key:\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniqueness: Every value in the primary key column(s) must be unique across all rows in the table. This ensures that each row can be uniquely identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-null: The primary key column(s) cannot contain null (empty) values. Each row must have a value in the primary key column(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "Stability: The values in the primary key should generally remain constant over time to avoid confusion and maintain the integrity of references to that row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a \"Students\" table with a primary key defined on the \"student_id\" column. Each student's ID is unique, and this ID is used to uniquely identify each student's record in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a field in a database table that is used to establish a link between the data in two different tables. It creates a relationship between the data in one table and the data in another, allowing for referential integrity and maintaining consistency across related tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of a foreign key:\n",
    "\n",
    "References Primary Key: A foreign key in one table references the primary key of another table. This creates a link between the two tables based on the values in these keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintains Referential Integrity: Foreign keys help enforce referential integrity by ensuring that values in the foreign key column(s) of one table correspond to existing values in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Allows Joins: Foreign keys are commonly used to join related tables in queries, allowing you to retrieve information from multiple tables based on their relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose you have two tables, \"Orders\" and \"Customers.\" The \"Orders\" table might have a foreign key called \"customer_id,\" which references the primary key \"customer_id\" in the \"Customers\" table. This establishes a relationship between orders and the customers who placed them. The foreign key ensures that each order is associated with an existing customer."
